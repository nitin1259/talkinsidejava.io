 *         Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter
 *         of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the
 *         longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may
 *         not pass through the root.
 * 
 *         Example: Given a binary tree 1 / \ 2 3 / \ 4 5 Return 3, which is the
 *         length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
 * 
 *         Note: The length of path between two nodes is represented by the
 *         number of edges between them
